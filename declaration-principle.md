The Principle of Declaration

Declaration is an ontological act, not an operational one.

It answers only one question:
Is this allowed to stand without explanation?

Declaration does not ask:

• Will it sell?

• Will it help?

• Will it continue?

• Will it scale?

The artifact does not owe the field anything in return.
