Boundary Between Declaration and Release

Declaration does not imply:

• readiness

• availability

• exposure

• distribution

Release belongs to a different layer.

No artifact may move toward release unless:

• another explicit permission layer allows it

• silence remains intact

• non-response invariants still hold

This boundary must never blur.
