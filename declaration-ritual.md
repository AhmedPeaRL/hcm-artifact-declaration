The Declaration Act

Declaration is intentionally simple and low-energy.

Allowed forms:

• a filename

• a timestamp

• a short presence note

• silent registration

Forbidden forms:

• launch language

• announcement tone

• framing

• explanation

• promotion

The act should feel almost unnecessary.
If it feels important, pause.
