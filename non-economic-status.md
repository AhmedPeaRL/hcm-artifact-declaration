Economic Neutrality of Declaration

Declaration has zero economic meaning.

A declared artifact:

• is not priced

• is not offered

• is not positioned

• is not linked to channels

Any economic interpretation at this stage is a violation.

Economy may happen later — or never.
Declaration neither accelerates nor blocks it.
