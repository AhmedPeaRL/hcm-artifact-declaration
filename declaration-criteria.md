Criteria for Declaration (Non-Quantitative)

An entity may be declared an artifact if:

• It can exist without narrative

• It does not require justification

• It does not request continuation

• It does not depend on response

• Its absence would not be a loss

There are no numerical thresholds.
There are no frequency rules.
There is no merit test.

If doubt exists → declaration is postponed, not forced.
