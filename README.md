# hcm-artifact-declaration

This repository defines the act of declaration within the HCM field.

• Declaration is not creation.

• Declaration is not selection.

• Declaration is not endorsement.

Declaration is the act of saying:
“This may exist as itself.”

Nothing declared here is:

• promised

• prepared

• optimized

• monetized

• directed

An artifact may be declared and never seen again.
The system remains whole.
